# Topic 1: Python Basics

In the previous topic, you were introduced to programming and Python. In this step we want to further improve your Python skills. 

- Study: [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) by Eric Matthes
We reccomend you work through every chapter and projects.

This book is a great resource for beginners to learn Python programming. It covers the basics of Python syntax, data structures, functions, and modules. The book also includes hands-on projects to help you practice your skills and build real-world applications. 

## Test your knowledge

Once you are done with the book, watch the [CS50 lecture on Python](https://youtu.be/LfaMVlDaQ24?feature=shared&t=49364). Everything here should make sense to you, if not, you are not ready to move on.

Test your knowledge with an AI assistant, here are some example prompts to test your Python knowledge:

1. Can you ask me about the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
2. Can you quiz me on how to create a dictionary in Python?
3. Can you ask me to explain the concept of list comprehensions with an example?
4. Can you ask me what a lambda function is and how it is used?
5. Can you quiz me on how to handle exceptions in Python?
6. Can you ask me about Python decorators and how they work?
7. Can you ask me to explain the difference between `__init__` and `__new__` methods in Python classes?
8. Can you quiz me on how to read and write files in Python?
9. Can you ask me about generators in Python and how they differ from regular functions?
10. Can you quiz me on how to use the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions in Python?
