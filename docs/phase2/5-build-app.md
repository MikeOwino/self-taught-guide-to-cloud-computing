# Topic 5: Capstone


Create an API with serverless functions that display movie information. Don't forget to create a GitHub repo and document in your README.md

### Capstone Steps

1. **Create Your Cloud Infrastructure:**

    - Use an SDK to set up your cloud infrastructure.
    - You will need a NoSQL database, cloud storage, and serverless functions.
    - Depending on the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), additional setup steps may be required.

2. **Prepare Your Data:**
    - Find movie data or create it and store it in your cloud NoSQL db.
    - Store movie cover images of each movie in cloud storage.

3. **Create Serverless Functions:**
    1. **GetMovies:** Returns a JSON list of all movies in your database. Ensure the response includes a URL for the movie cover.
    2. **GetMoviesByYear:** Returns a list of movies released in a specified year. The year is provided by the client.
    3. **EXTRA CREDIT - GetMovieSummary:** Returns a summary generated by AI for a specified movie.

#### Example Data Model

Your movie data model could look like:
```json
{
    "title":"title of the movie",
    "releaseYear":"when the movie was released",
    "genre":"genre of the movie",
    "coverUrl":"url-to-image-in-cloud-storage"
}
```

#### Example API Endpoints

- **GetMovies** `yourapi.com/getmovies`

```json
[
    {
        "title": "Inception",
        "releaseYear": "2010",
        "genre": "Science Fiction, Action",
        "coverUrl": "https://example.com/inception.jpg"
     },
    {
        "title": "The Shawshank Redemption",
        "releaseYear": "1994",
        "genre": "Drama, Crime",
        "coverUrl": "https://example.com/shawshank-redemption.jpg"
    },
    {
        "title": "The Dark Knight",
        "releaseYear": "2008",
        "genre": "Action, Crime, Drama",
        "coverUrl": "https://example.com/dark-knight.jpg"
    }
]
```

- **GetMoviesByYear** `yourapi.com/getmoviesbyyear/2010`

```json
[
    {
        "title": "Inception",
        "releaseYear": "2010",
        "genre": "Science Fiction, Action",
        "coverUrl": "https://example.com/inception.jpg"
    }
]
```

- **GetMovieSummary** `yourapi.com/getmoviesummary/inception`

```json
{
    "title": "Inception",
    "releaseYear": "2010",
    "genre": "Science Fiction, Action",
    "coverUrl": "https://example.com/inception.jpg",
    "generatedSummary": "A mind-bending sci-fi thriller about dream theft and manipulation."
}
```
