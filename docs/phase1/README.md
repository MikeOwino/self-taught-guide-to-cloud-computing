# Phase 1: Linux and Bash

Here at Learn to Cloud, we like to get hands-on as soon as possible. So, we've prepared a Capture The Flag (CTF) lab for you to practice your Linux and Bash. Before you can access them, you'll spend time learning about the lab and setting it up. Don't worry â€“ along the way, we'll provide tips, documentation links, resources, and more to help you succeed.

## Objectives

By the end of this phase, you will have:

- Set up your computer for all our labs
- Learned the basics of version control
- Gained familiarity with the cloud CLI
- Understood the concept of Infrastructure as Code
- Built and accessed the lab environment
- Completed seven CTF challenges to test your Linux skills

## Prerequisites

- Mac OS or a Ubuntu based computer. If you're on Windows, you'll use WSL.
